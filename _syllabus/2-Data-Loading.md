<!-- ### Before Class
Read Chapters 1-2 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book -->

### Summary
Simplest encoding of spin-Â½ hardcore-bosons to qubits; generic challenges illustrated with mapping fermions (electrons in molecules) with different commutation rules; encodings for classical data and their limitations; construct boson encodings as a class activity

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.
