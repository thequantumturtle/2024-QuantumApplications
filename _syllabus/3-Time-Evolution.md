<!-- ### Before Class
Read Chapter 3 in the [Octopus](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683) Book -->

### Summary
Describe applications of time evolution of a quantum system; present simple methods such as Trotterization; more recent and complex methods such as qubitization; no fast forwarding; relationship between quantum coherence time and simulation time; code a Trotter simulation; predict photo-reactivity of a small molecule with time evolution.

### Notes

- Reminder to bring computer to class.
